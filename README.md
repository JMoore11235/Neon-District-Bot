# Neon-District-Bot
Bot written in VBA with Selenium. Excel should contain the code. I've also uploaded the VBA code into .txt files, so you don't have to download the Excel file to view the code.

Currently botting is banned in Neon District, so I won't update or provide details on how to run this. However, in the event that botting becomes unbanned, I might update this/tell people how to run them if it doesn't hurt me to do so. Also, if you do manage to run this, be warned that Neon District's anti-botting filter is extremely sensitive. This not only gives them many false postives, but also flags any account that this runs on, pretty much instantly.
